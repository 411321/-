She had always loved him from afar, but never dared to confess her feelings. He was too popular, too handsome, too perfect for someone like her. She was just a shy librarian who spent her days reading books and dreaming of romance.

But one day, everything changed. He walked into the library and asked for her help. He needed to find a book on ancient history for his research paper. She felt her heart skip a beat as she looked into his deep blue eyes and smiled nervously.

She led him to the right section and handed him a book. He thanked her and asked for her name. She told him it was Lily. He said his name was Jake and that he was a senior at the university. He asked if she was a student too.

She shook her head and said she worked at the library full-time. She had graduated two years ago with a degree in literature. He said he admired that and that he loved reading too.

They started talking about their favorite books and authors. They found out they had a lot in common. They both loved fantasy novels, historical fiction, and poetry.

They lost track of time as they chatted away. They didn’t notice that the library was closing until the announcement came over the speakers.

They looked at each other and realized they had to go. He asked for her phone number and said he wanted to see her again.

She gave it to him without hesitation and felt a surge of hope in her chest.

He said goodbye and kissed her hand gently.

She watched him leave with a smile on her face.

She couldn’t believe it.

He liked her back.
